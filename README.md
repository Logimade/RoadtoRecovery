# Road to Recovery

Road to Recovery is a project designed to facilitate seamless video and audio transmission between a Medic located at a hospital and a Paramedic in an ambulance. The Paramedic wears a VR headset with passthrough enabled, which is mirrored onto a laptop using `scrcpy` and then transmitted over VNC to the Medic. This allows the Medic to see the live feed and guide the Paramedic through necessary medical procedures.

## Features

- **Real-time Video and Audio Transmission:** Live video feed from the Paramedicâ€™s VR headset to the Medic.
- **VR Headset Passthrough:** Allows the Paramedic to see their surroundings while transmitting the view.
- **scrcpy Integration:** Mirrors the VR headset feed onto a laptop.
- **VNC Transmission:** Transmits the mirrored feed from the laptop to the Medic's client.
- **Two-way Communication:** Enables the Medic to provide real-time instructions to the Paramedic.

## System Requirements

### Paramedic Side (Ambulance)
- VR Headset with Passthrough capability
- Android Device
